What happens when you initialize a repository?
git starts to create hidden files to track the history 
of the files in the repository.

What is the value of the staging area.
keep track of files you changed since the last commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure that your commit
contains only one logical change?
use git diff without further attributes to compare
the files in your staging area and working directory
use gif diff --staged to compare the files in the staging area
and the repository.
by doing this you can make sure to commit only one logical change
