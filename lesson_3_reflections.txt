When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. to save important files, so they won't get lost
2. to share my work with the public
3. to collaborate

Why might you wnat to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
someone could make a lot of commits to your remote repository.
if it kept up-to-date automatically, you might have to spend time to reverse the changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
you can use fork directly on GitHub to copy someone else's repository to your site. doing this, everyone can see the original creator of the content. after doing this you can use clone to copy the repository on your site to your computer. 
branches are different

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
even if you are offline, you can still look at the differences between master and origin/master. merge them, etc.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
it would be very difficult to see who changed what and when.
so, it is better to always use github to collaborate

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
espacially, when you want to collaborate, you can not directly
change the master branch of the remote.
thus, you make a new branch, push it and make a pull request
