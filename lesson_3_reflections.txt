When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. to save important files, so they won't get lost
2. to share my work with the public
3. to collaborate

Why might you wnat to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
someone could make a lot of commits to your remote repository.
if it kept up-to-date automatically, you might have to spend time to reverse the changes.
